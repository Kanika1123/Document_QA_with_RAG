# Document Q&A with RAG

This project is a lightweight implementation of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** for answering questions from documents.  
It combines **embeddings** (MiniLM) with a **vector store (FAISS)** to retrieve relevant text chunks and generate answers.



##  Project Structure
- `rag_app.py` â€“ the main Streamlit app
- `tech.txt` â€“ document with technology-related content (ML, DL, Cloud, Full Stack)
- `ai.txt` â€“ document with AI-related content
- `blockchain.txt` â€“ document with blockchain-related content
- `README.md` â€“ project documentation



##  Features
- Upload any `.txt` document.
- Text is **split into chunks** for better retrieval.
- FAISS index is built from embeddings.
- Ask natural language questions about the document.
- Adjustable number of chunks (`k`) to tune retrieval.
- Simple Streamlit interface.
